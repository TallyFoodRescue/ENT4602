# Tally Food Rescue – Digital Media and Web Development Initiative

## Project Overview

This repository contains the collaborative development work conducted in partnership with Tally Food Rescue, a nonprofit organization dedicated to reducing food waste and addressing food insecurity within the Tallahassee community.

The purpose of this project is to design and implement interactive digital media and web-based solutions that support Tally Food Rescue’s mission.

## Organizational Context

Tally Food Rescue operates at the intersection of sustainability and community support. The organization recovers surplus food from local businesses and redistributes it to individuals and community partners facing food insecurity. In doing so, it simultaneously reduces environmental waste and expands equitable access to essential resources.

As food insecurity continues to affect communities nationwide, scalable technological solutions are increasingly important for streamlining coordination, communication, and impact measurement.
